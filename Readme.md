Project #2: The Online Fruit Store

Project Details

Index Page
Your app should have an index page where

all the products are displayed
the images link to the product's show page
and there should be a link to add a new product.
 

Show Page

1.Your show page should display a product with

    a link back to the products
    a link to edit the product (goes to the edit page)
    a delete button that deletes

2.Example: 

3.If the quantity of your item is zero, the show page should say 'OUT OF STOCK' instead of saying how many are remaining. (Hint: conditionals in jsx).

4.On the edit page, make sure you can set the quantity to zero if you want so that you can test if this is working.

5.The BUY button should also not be rendered if the quantity of the item is zero

New & Edit Page
1.These views should render forms and submit to the appropriate routes.
 

Redirects

1.The create route should redirect to the index
2.The delete route should redirect to the index
3.The update route will redirect back to the product's show page.

Technical Requirements

1.Your app MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above explaining what is wrong

2.Must contain all 7 Restful Routes.

3.Must be styled and look like a store.

4.You MUST have a well documented README file in your repo. PLEASE add this README.md file on your own NOT through GitHub... Trust me...  

5.In lieu of presentations, you MUST create a video (on YouTube, Vimeo, etc...) of you showcasing your application and code. This video needs to be in your README file, and must be at least 3 minutes long.
